# Microcorruption - New Orleans

## Approach
Since there was a place where the input values were compared character by character with the function called `create-password`, the comparison target character string is extracted.
When I extracted it, it was the following 7 characters
> 0x69 0x2f 0x76 0x36 0x77 0x39 0x3e

## Flag (Hex)
> 692f763677393e
